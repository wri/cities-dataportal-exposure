# Cities Exposure Data Portal pilot

Welcome to the City Data Portal project repository dedicated to the assement of cities' exposure to natural hazards.

**This is a work in progress repository! It is not yet an official WRI repository. 
For more information about the project status, please contact Eric.Mackres@wri.org.**

This repository provides:

- **Data Exploration**: Scripts for exploring cities' exposure indicators to naturla hazards: extreme heat events and flooding
- **Data Pipeline**: Scripts for collecting, processing and storing data needed for exposure assessment: administrative boundaries, amenity locations, population distribution, land surface temperature...
- **Dashboard**: Scripts for building an inteactive dashboard to visualize the computed exposure indicators
