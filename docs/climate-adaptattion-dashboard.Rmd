# Introduction

As a part of the Data Portal for Cities project, this work aims at providing a prototype tool for helping cities in climate hazards adaptation planning. 

The following document describes the methodological framework used for computing indicators on amenity exposure to heat hazards.

## Administrative boundaries

Two data sources are used for collecting the administrative boundaries regarding the selected cities: the geoBoudnaries database and Open Street Map. 

## Amenities

### Amenity data
Amenity data is provided by Open Street Map and collected by the mean of the [Overpass API](https://python-overpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html). OpenStreetMap's [free tagging system](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags) allows the map to include an unlimited number of attributes describing each feature. These tags are represented in *key: value* structure. The *key*, is used to describe a topic, category, or type of feature (e.g., highway or name). The *value* provides detail for the key-specified feature. For example, school features can be tagged with `key = amenity and value = school`.

For each city, we collected the location and attributes of available amenities situated within the city boundary. The data is stored in Google Cloud Storage bucket. 

### Sector categories

In order to provide exposure indicators by sector, we associated each amenity with a sector name based on the sector taxonomy provided by the CRF document of GCOM. This mapping between the amenities and sector categories is provided by the mean of a mapping file stored in the datalake.

## Land Surface Temperature (LST)

Land Surface Temperature estimation within the city boundary is based on Landsat data provided with high spatial resolution (30m). In order to collect this data, we used an open source library provided by `Sofia L. Ermida` based on the Google Earth Engine ([Link to the artilce](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/9/1471)). We extracted for each city an average heat value for a 3 months period corresponding to the hot season.
Here is an example of parameters used for collecting LST data for the city of 'Marroco':
 
``` js
var satellite = 'L8';
var date_start = '2018-03-01';
var date_end = '2021-04-30';
var month_start = 6;
var month_end = 9;
var use_ndvi = true;
```

## Amenity exposure

### Amenity exposure definition

Amenity exposure to heat may be quantified simply as the heat value (as collected from Landsat) at the amenity location. Since our goal consists of identifying the most exposed amenities within each city, we need to define an indicator that may inform us about within city variability of exposed amenities.

Two methods have been explored for quantifying amenity exposure to heat:

- **Deviation from city average heat value**: It consists of comparing each amenity heat value with the city average heat value (considered hence as exposure threshold). 
$$Exposure_{amenity} = (\frac {Heat_{amenity}}{HeatThreshold_{city}} * 100) - 100$$
- **Deviation from average amenity heat value**: It consists of computing for each amenity a deviation ratio to the whole average amenities heat.

$$Exposure_{amenity} = (\frac {Heat_{amenity}}{HeatThreshold_{city}} * 100) - 100$$


### Sector exposure definition

Two metrices are provided in order to characterize sectors' exposure to heat:

- **Average deviation ratio by sector**: It consists of computing the average deviation ratio of amenities at the sector level. 

- **Percent of exposed amenities**: It consists of computing for each sector the percent of amenities with heat value above the average.

### Exposure Index

Amenity exposure level depends on two components: Number of amenities and heat deviation ratio. In order to identify the location of exposure hotspots, we propose here to compute an exposure index by spatially weighting the number of amenities by the heat deviation ratio as expressed by the following equations:

- Computing exposure index values:

$$ExposureLevel_{cell} =\sum_{x = i}^{nb_{cells}}NumberOfAmenities_{i}*ExposureAmenity_{i}$$

- Normalizing the exposure index:

$$ExposureIndex_{cell} = \frac {ExposureLevel_{cell} - min(ExposureLevel_{city})}{max(ExposureLevel_{city}) - min(ExposureLevel_{city})}$$


### Limitations & Perspectives

- **Amenity data coverage:** In this analysis we used amenity deata provided by Open Street Map API. Since the data is not complete and may differ between cities, our results are biased by data coverage. More efforts are then needed for evaluating data coverage and integratin other datasources such as [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) or [Google Open Buildings dataset](https://sites.research.google/open-buildings/).

- **Definition of heat hazard**

- **Definition of the most relevant administrative level in the boundaries data**

#### Map

- **Layer 1: Land Surface Temperature:** 

This layer shows the spatial distribution of land surface temperature within the city boundary at 30m resolution. 

- **Layer 2: Amenity exposure value:**

This layer shows the heat value corresponding to the amenities positions (based on land surface temperature layer).

- **Layer 3: Amenity exposure class:**

This layer shows amenities' exposure classification based on the deviation ratio of the user' selected heat threshold. Three classes are proposed: `Low` (amenities are located in area with lower heat value than heat threshold), `Moderate` (amenities are located in area with heat deviation ratio up to 10% higher than heat threshold), and `high` (amenities are located in area with heat deviation ratio 10% higher than heat threshold).
